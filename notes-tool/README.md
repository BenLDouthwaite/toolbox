# Notes Tool

Program intended as a command line tool, for processing my task lists.

Primarily based around markdown task lists.

## Dev Tasks

- [ ] Add some integration / unit tests.
- [ ] Create cronjob / command to run the 'create' script daily
- [ ] Extract rules for what content to copy from the previous day into a service
- [ ] Allow more formatting. particularly whitespace
    - [ ] Keep headers?
- [ ] Would be interesting to track the 'age' of tasks.
  - [ ] Once they reach a certain 'age', move to top priority, have a flag of some sort.
